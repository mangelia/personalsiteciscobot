            <h2>Notifiers</h2>
            <p>Notifier bots typically respond to events in external services and post a summary in Webex. For example, a GitHub Bot may listen for commits on a particular repo and post the committer's name and comment into a Webex space set aside for this purpose. Or a Deal Bot that lives in an account-specific space and posts updates from a CRM along with relevant news about the company like a product launch or earnings report.</p>
            <h2>Controllers</h2>
            <p>Controller bots act as a text-based remote control for external services. For example, a Jira Bot may allow software engineers and product managers to control or query information from the popular bug tracking system Jira, all from the comfort of a Webex space. Controller bots are generally passive, waiting for someone in the room to issue a command. In group rooms, bots can only see messages in which they are mentioned (1:1 rooms bots can see all messages as they are automatically "mentioned"). Your users are required to mention the bot preceding the command like @jira find WEBSITE-22 where @jira is the bot's name. Currently, the Webex SDKs do not support extracting commands from messages. You'll need to parse it out after the mention. Future versions of the Webex SDKs will have built-in support for commands. Keep your eyes on the blog for updates.</p>
            <h2>Assistants</h2>
            <p>Virtual assistants are the holy grail of chatbots. At minimum, an assistant should understand natural language, allowing the user to ask it questions as they would to a human. Recent advancements in NLP (Natural Language Processing) have made understanding natural language requests not only possible, but quite accessible to the average developer. Most notably, Google launched Google Cloud Natural Language API in the summer of 2016, providing syntax parsing, sentiment analysis and deep noun classification. Responding to natural language is a good first step but a truly exceptional assistant bot will be conversational, using past interactions to contextualize the most recent query. This is a very complex problem domain; luckily there are companies like Dialogflow providing a conversational platform built specifically for bots.</p>
