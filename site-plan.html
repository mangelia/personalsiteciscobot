        Bots Explained
Bots are similar to regular Webex users. They can participate in 1-to-1 and group spaces and users can message them directly or add them to a group space. A special badge is added to a bot's avatar in the Webex clients so users know they're interacting with a bot instead of a human.
A bot can only access messages sent to it directly. In group spaces, bots must be @mentioned to access the message. In 1-to-1 spaces, a bot has access to all messages from the user.
Bots do not, however, perform actions within Webex on behalf of a Webex user. If you're creating an application that needs to participate in Webex and perform actions with a user's account, check out Integrations.

      <h3>Type of bots</h3>
      <p>
        Types of Bots
Bots come in all different shapes and sizes. Here are some ideas for a few different types of bots you can make:
Notifiers
Notifier bots typically respond to events in external services and post a summary in Webex. For example, a GitHub Bot may listen for commits on a particular repo and post the committer's name and comment into a Webex space set aside for this purpose. Or a Deal Bot that lives in an account-specific space and posts updates from a CRM along with relevant news about the company like a product launch or earnings report.
Controllers
Controller bots act as a text-based remote control for external services. For example, a Jira Bot may allow software engineers and product managers to control or query information from the popular bug tracking system Jira, all from the comfort of a Webex space.

Controller bots are generally passive, waiting for someone in the room to issue a command. In group rooms, bots can only see messages in which they are mentioned (1:1 rooms bots can see all messages as they are automatically "mentioned"). Your users are required to mention the bot preceding the command like @jira find WEBSITE-22 where @jira is the bot's name.
Currently, the Webex SDKs do not support extracting commands from messages. You'll need to parse it out after the mention. Future versions of the Webex SDKs will have built-in support for commands. Keep your eyes on the blog for updates.
Assistants
Virtual assistants are the holy grail of chatbots. At minimum, an assistant should understand natural language, allowing the user to ask it questions as they would to a human.
Recent advancements in NLP (Natural Language Processing) have made understanding natural language requests not only possible, but quite accessible to the average developer. Most notably, Google launched Google Cloud Natural Language API in the summer of 2016, providing syntax parsing, sentiment analysis and deep noun classification.
Responding to natural language is a good first step but a truly exceptional assistant bot will be conversational, using past interactions to contextualize the most recent query. This is a very complex problem domain; luckily there are companies like Dialogflow providing a conversational platform built specifically for bots.

        The Benefits Of Automation In Today's Workforce forbes
Robotics Can Increase Overall Productivity
When robots and automation are implemented in a business effectively, they don't replace jobs. They augment them to drive greater productivity. In fact, some research has shown that robots are actually driving the creation of new job positions. The difference in these jobs has to do with skill set. And since they require higher skill levels, the jobs they're providing have the potential to produce higher wages. That said, this shift in the industry will create a barrier for some workers who do not have the required accreditations for these higher-skilled jobs, but several companies have taken measures to overcome this. Many are choosing to invest in their employees' education in order to broaden their skills, including Amazon, L'Oreal and Adobe.
