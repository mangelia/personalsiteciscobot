            <h2>Bots Explained</h2>
            <p>Bots are similar to regular Webex users. They can participate in 1-to-1 and group spaces and users can message them directly or add them to a group space. A special badge is added to a bot's avatar in the Webex clients so users know they're interacting with a bot instead of a human. A bot can only access messages sent to it directly. In group spaces, bots must be @mentioned to access the message. In 1-to-1 spaces, a bot has access to all messages from the user. Bots do not, however, perform actions within Webex on behalf of a Webex user. If you're creating an application that needs to participate in Webex and perform actions with a user's account, check out Integrations.
